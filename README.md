# KNU-capstone design project1
## TOPIC
Construction of container environment using Kubernetes

## Develoment goals
The container environment, which has begun to attract attention with Docker and others, is drawing attention to the next level of IT development and operation following the virtualization of Hypervisor. 
In fact, many companies are making a lot of investment with the goal of building container environments through open-source tools such as **Kubernets** to provide flexibility in their IT environments.
Through this project, we will build a **Kubernets environment** and build a basic application environment on top of it.

## Development content and requirements
* Understanding container technology represented by Docker

* Build a Kubernetes cluster environment with three or more nodes

* Develop web applications with their familiar development languages ​​and deploy them over the Kubernetes environment

* The web application is a guestbook, which accepts names, affiliations, photos (files), stores text information in a database, and stores files in a shared volume on Kubernetes

* Loadbalancer at the front enables load balancing between applications deployed on three nodes

* Performance Test with Apache Bench

## Development period
