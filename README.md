TOPIC: Construction of container environment using Kubernetes

Develoment goals: The container environment, which has begun to attract attention with Docker and others, is drawing attention to the next level of IT development and operation following the virtualization of Hypervisor. 
In fact, many companies are making a lot of investment with the goal of building container environments through open-source tools such as Kubernets to provide flexibility in their IT environments.
Through this project, we will build a Kubernets environment and build a basic application environment on top of it.
